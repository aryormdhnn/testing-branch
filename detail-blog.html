        <p>Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. We have a saboteur aboard. We know you’re dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named “Enterprise.”</p>
        <p>The game not big enough unless it scares you a little. Wait a minute – you’ve been declared dead. You can’t give orders around here. I’ll alert the crew. What? We’re not at all alike! Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence.</p>

          <p>What’s a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I guess it’s better to be lucky than good.</p>
          <p>Damage report! I’ve had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Ensign Babyface! I’m afraid I still don’t understand, sir. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. You’re going to be an interesting companion.</p>
